### PROJECT OVERVIEW
We're building <strong>GIGS</strong> - A website where creators of art (e.g: writers, digital creators, etc)can upload their work and make money from it. For the Nigerian and African creator at large.

### TARGET AUDIENCE
- African content creators - digital creations include but are not limited to written content, photography, graphics, audio, and video production that is used on social media, in the blogosphere, online/offline etc.
- Users seeking to patronize the artists

### GOALS OF THE PROJECT
- To help African creators reach a wider audience and sell their products to customers around the globe aided by this platform driven by that sole intention.

### PROJECT FEATURES
- **An about us page:** To educate users/visitors on what GIGS is all about and how we can help to promote their business thus helping make them more money.
- **A signup/login feature:** To manage access to the platform, the security of the work displayed and it's overall authenticity, as works will be linked to individual profiles.
- **A profile feature:** To identify creators and match them with their original work. This can be a portfolio builder and can be tied to other portfolio platforms.
- **A gallery feature:** To display work of creators registered on the platform in an organised and functional manner.
- **A search function:** To find the desired work of the preferred creator, find contact details of your favourite creator and keep up with his/her activities.
- **A market place:** To advertise, promote and sell creators work and services. This should have robust payment functions embedded.

### Some extra things to keep in mind while coding
Write code for:
1. Readability
- Imagine the person reviewing your code has an axe and knows your house address
3. Modularity
- How easy is it to reuse bits of your code?
- When you have an error, how easy is it to narrow down to the exact section of code that's responsible for a problem
4. Efficiency
- How fast does this work?
5. Length
